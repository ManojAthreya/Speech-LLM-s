A speech-to-text (STT) system, or sometimes called automatic speech recognition (ASR) is as its name implies: A way of transforming the spoken words via sound into textual data that can be used later for any purpose.

Speech recognition technology is extremely useful. It can be used for a lot of applications such as the automation of transcription, writing books/texts using sound only, enabling complicated analysis on information using the generated textual files and a lot of other things.

In the past, the speech-to-text technology was dominated by proprietary software and libraries. Open source speech recognition alternatives didnâ€™t exist or existed with extreme limitations and no community around.

This is changing, today there are a lot of open source speech-to-text tools and libraries that you can use right now.
